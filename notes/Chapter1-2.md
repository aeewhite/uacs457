### Difference between Data and Database

**Data** are recorded, known facts.

**Database** is a collection of logically coherent, related data. 
It represents a miniworld, designed and build for a specific purposes, 
for a specific user group for preconceived applications.

A **Database Management System** is software to manage, create, and maintain a database. In a **Database Management System**, you define the types of the data, while it controls the data on disk. It also allows you to manipulate the data.

### Why use it?

Quite a few reasons:

- Program-Data Independence
- Data Abstractions
- Conceptual Representation
- Meta Data
- Share Data
- Multiple Views
- Transaction Processing

But the biggest and most important: **Optimization**. 

A **Database System** is the combination of **Data** and a **Database Management System**.

The **Database System** has both the 

- **schema** (skee-mah) or **meta-data**
- **instance** or **actual data**

### 3 Schema Architecture

- **External View**
- **Conceptual**
- **Internal**

### Data Model

Describes the **structure**.

- Record
- Types
- Relationships
- Constrations
- Basic Operations

Types of **Data Models**

- High Level (UML)
- Low Level (XML)
- Implementation (Relational)
- NoSQL (Column, Key-Value, Document Stores)

### Data Languages

- DDL
	- Data Definition Language
- DML
	- Data Manipulation Language
- SQL
	- Structured Query Language.
	- Combines both DDL and DML.
